# 3005B-AlyssaChow
 Final project for COMP3005B.

Not for distribution. Please.

I made the error of having the node modules folder in this, sorry. 

Have your postgreSQL database ready and insert the .sql files. Start with the DDL.sql first.

In your terminal at the correct path:
npm install
node app.js

Then go to localhost:8080 and begin.

I am not too sure how the password and username will effect the running of this program due the code using a specific login that was valid on my computer. If it doesn't work, you might have to edit the code for the login to fit yours.
